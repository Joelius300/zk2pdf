# zk2pdf

Instead of using [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/) or something similar to serve a Zettelkasten (made with [zk](https://github.com/zk-org/zk)), I sometimes need a simple printed reference.
This script uses zk's awesome filter and matching capabilities and pandoc to create a pdf with all notes tagged with a certain tag, and optionally all links from those.
